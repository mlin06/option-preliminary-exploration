# Project Title
This project looks at option price data for Tesla (Tsla) and Coinbase (Coin) and draws the call option price along different strike prices with varying expiry dates. Compare that with implied volatilities (IV) at each data point. 

The data point with higher IV and interval space along the weekly curve may indicate that the call option is overpriced relative to the same strike price along different expiry weekly curves. Therefore, the higher-priced option may be attractive compared to the call option with the same strike price and varying expiry dates. 

I also looked at the stock's last 365 days' daily return to create a distribution chart for the possibility of returns to help investors to figure out the probability of the x% returns in y days.
